            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <article>
                <p class="justified-text">Hello! I am Igor, and I have spent the last 15 years deeply involved in the
                    tech
                    industry. Beyond my
                    professional life, I
                    have a strong passion for investing, which I actively pursue in my downtime. I also hold a real
                    estate
                    license and work
                    part-time helping friends and family navigate the real estate market. </p>
                <p>I decided to center my
                    project around real estate because it represents a key part of the American dream. Despite its
                    allure,
                    many people do not
                    fully understand the intricacies, risks, and costs associated with owning property. Over the years,
                    real
                    estate has been
                    seen not only as a sound investment but also as a way to hedge against inflation. However, in our
                    current global
                    economy, real estate competes with other investments like cryptocurrencies and stocks, which offer
                    higher returns
                    but come with increased risks. It is a classic scenario of high risk, high reward. Through this
                    website,
                    I aim to demystify the complexities of real estate investment and offer valuable insights that can
                    guide you towards making confident and informed decisions in this competitive and ever-evolving
                    market.
