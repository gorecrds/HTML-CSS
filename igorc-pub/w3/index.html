                    <p>Before deciding to invest, it is essential to understand that all investments carry some
                        level of risk, including the
                        potential loss of principal, and there is no assurance that any investment strategy will be
                        successful. The value of
                        your investments can go up as well as down, and you may get back less than you originally
                        invested. Apps do not protect your Investment</p>

                            companies in
                            the U.S. It is widely regarded as the best single gauge of large-cap U.S. equities. Over the

                            years, the S&P 500 has seen significant growth, around 100-110%, indicative of the overall
                            growth and
