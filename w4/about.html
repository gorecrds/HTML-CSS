            <h2>Why I'm Taking This Course</h2>
            <p>
                I'm keen on refreshing my knowledge of HTML5 and CSS. I have been working in technology for several
                years
                now. One of my biggest academic achievement, was a Masters in Software Engineering back in 2016. Lately
                I
                have been exploring the realm of AI. I do think it will be the next big thing; if isn't already.
                I'm hoping this class will provide more depth and structure than what I could achieve by self-studying
                or
                watching tutorials in platforms such as LinkedIn Learning, MasterClass, and YouTube. There was a time
                when
                I was deeply involved in website development, but I shifted gears to back-end work and have since felt
                somewhat
                disconnected from the latest in front-end development. The landscape has certainly evolved, with many
                now
                favoring frameworks for their speed and efficiency in development. Despite this, I believe it's crucial
                to
                get back to the basics and solidify those foundational skills.

            <h2>What I think about using ChatGPT for Research</h2>
            <p>
                I belive ChatGPT is a ground breaking technology as welll as a double-edged sword. It's super handy,
                efficient towards offering quick answers and help when you need it. But, there's that tricky part where
                it's easy to get a bit too comfy with it, right? We might lean on it
                more than we should and miss out on digging deeper into stuff ourselves. In way, I believe it can
                diminish one's ability to skills such as critical thinking and problem-solving skills could diminish

                Looking ahead, I envision a future where AI, particularly chatbots, integrates with virtual reality to
                create immersive work place and educational environments. Imagine a virtual classroom where students
                gather to learn, where a chatbot serve as a tutor or facilitator, offering personalized assistance,
                answering questions, and guiding discussions 24/7. The unfortunate side of
                things is that I believe AI will significantly transform the job market, displacing many roles that
                currently rely on routine or predictable tasks.
